Adaptive Background Mixture Model

- Forma adaptada e aprimorada do modelo de grimson (multi-colour background model per pixel -> the method suffers
from slow learning at the beginning, especially in busy environments. In addition, it can not distinguish
between moving shadows and moving objects.

-Background subtraction involves calculating a reference image, subtracting each new frame from
this image and thresholding the result.What results is a binary segmentation of the image which highlights
regions of non-stationary objects

Histogram of Oriented Gradients

- Gradient measure: sobel filter
